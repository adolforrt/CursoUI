							<h1>The Great Batman Banner Hunt is On!</h1>
							<h2>
							Sometimes Batman hides in the shadows. Sometimes he hides in a collection of DC Comics Facebook banners.
							</h2>
							<p>
							Batman Day is Saturday, September 26, and to help fans like you get into the spirit, we’ve updated many of our Facebook banners. Perhaps you noticed.
							That’s the new banner you’ll find on our Aquaman Facebook page. Yes, they celebrate Batman Day in Atlantis. And no, I don’t know how they keep their free Batman comic book from getting sopping wet. But what's really important is...
							
							Did you notice anything about the image above? There’s the Batman Day logo, but what’s that off there to the left?
							It IS Batman. But he’s not in the original art. We added him in as a sort of Batman Day Easter Egg, and have done the same for eight more of our Facebook banners.

							<h1>Preview Monday: Superman/Wonder Woman #21</h1>
							<h2>
							Welcome back for Preview Monday! This week we are giving a sneak peek at SUPERMAN/WONDER WOMAN #21.
							</h2>
							<p>
							This Wednesday in an all new SUPERMAN/WONDER WOMAN #21 the epic “Truth” arc hits close to the heart as dark secrets come to light, forcing Superman and Wonder Woman to question whether their relationship can work in this new world of identities revealed and questionable actions. Make sure to check SUPERMAN/WONDER WOMAN #21 written by Peter J. Tomasi with art by Doug Mahnke, Jaime Mendoza, Mark Irwin, Sean Parsons and Scott Hanna.

							<h1>Voicing Vixen: An Interview with Megalyn Echikunwoke</h1>
							<h2></h2>
							<p>
							The fourth episode of Vixen, the animated digital series set within the Arrow and Flash TV universe, debuts today on CW Seed. It’s arguably the best episode yet, finding our wildlife-fueled hero being put to her first real test as she attempts to escape from the Flash and Arrow (voiced by guest stars Grant Gustin and Stephen Amell). The pace of the episode is relentless and the confrontation is a pretty spectacular set piece that gives us the first real glimmer of the potential Vixen has as a hero in this already rich world. If you’re anything like us, it’ll leave you itching for the next episode. But since that’s still a week away, we thought we’d fill some of that time by talking Vixen with the gifted actress behind the animated hero—Megalyn Echikunwoke.

							<h1>First Look: DC's Legends of Tomorrow's Hawkgirl and Hawkman</h1>
							<h2>
							Hawkgirl and Hawkman fans are about to see their two favorite heroes take wing on DC’s Legends of Tomorrow. But how will they look? Pretty awesome, it turns out…
							</h2>
							<p>
							That’s Ciara Renée as Kendra Saunders and Falk Hentschel as her soulmate Carter Hall in the first official image of the two characters. With powers derived from the ancient Egyptian hawk god, Horus, Kendra and Carter are destined to reincarnate through time as winged, helmeted warriors. On DC’s Legends of Tomorrow, Hawkgirl and Hawkman will fight alongside the Atom, Firestorm, White Canary, Captain Cold and Heat Wave against the immortal Vandal Savage. Look for them to initially debut in this season’s Arrow and The Flash crossover episode before moving on to DC’s Legends of Tomorrow.
